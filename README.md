# UwU


**We've managed to build 2 mini-projects for hackoverflow! One went surprisingly well, and one needs more work.**

## The first one is, our attempt at TETRIS! And the second one, is an OCR project which we're hoping to put in the 5th category(Open Innovation). The idea is to be able to read medical labels,and put the texts into a search engine, so that we get information about the components involved in it,its side-effects,what possible substitutes we can consider instead of that particular medicine, and if it's expired, find the nearest place to get it from!
