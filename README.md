**We've managed to build 2 mini-projects for hackoverflow! One went surprisingly well, and one needs more work.**

## The first one is, our attempt at TETRIS! And the second one, is an OCR project which we're hoping to put in the 5th category(Open Innovation)

TEAM NAME    : UwU

TEAM MEMBERS : 
               
               1.Sudha Sree Yerramsetty 

               2. Vishnu Priya Thammina

               3. Isha Valiveti
               
You just need to run the tetris code in VS code and you're good to go! And for the second project, it needs a few modifications(through Android Studio)
